     <!-- Description -->
    <p>
        This air fryer French fries recipe includes a cold water-hot water soaking trick that produces super crispy French fries.
        Made with just four ingredients, these fries rival traditional fries but use a fraction of the oil.
        Serve with burgers, steak, or chicken with something to dip them in, like honey mustard, spicy ketchup, or garlic aioli.

    <!-- Ingredients -->

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- Steps -->
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut each potato lengthwise into 3/8-inch-thick slices, then slice sections into 3/8-inch-wide sticks. Place potatoes in a bowl of cold water. Let soak to release excess starches, about 5 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Pour boiling water over the potatoes until they're covered by a few inches. Let sit for 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and transfer onto some paper towels. Blot off excess water and let cool completely, at least 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place cooled potatoes in a mixing bowl. Drizzle with oil and season with cayenne; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Stack potatoes in a double layer in the fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Cook for 15 minutes. Slide basket out and toss fries. Continue frying until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Toss fries with salt in a mixing bowl. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ul>
